# Monarch_RearConditionComparison
The first experiment of my Master's project that I ran to collect preliminary data on effect of rearing condition on Monarch adult physiology and respirometry. Larvae were fed Tropical Milkweed (Asclepais curassavica) and raised in environmental chambers set to mimic Summer-or-Fall-like temperatures and photoperiod similar to that of Central Pennsylvania during these seasons.
